# lichesslite
Consider this my final project after finishing html and css. Used grid,flex and media queries and made my site responsive. I learnt a lot by cloning one of my favourite websites which is lichess.com. I can do a little better with fonts and their sizes. Also I can add some hower animations to some buttons here and there.
